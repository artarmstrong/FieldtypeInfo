# ProcessWire - FieldTypeInfo

This ProcessWire module produces a fieldtype that would allow you to define information only that is displayed in the field's output.

After installing, you'll have a new "Information" fieldtype that will allow you to define the information you'd like in the output. You'll be able to define these options in a text box on the field's configuration screen.

This is meant to be a helper on template pages only and not for output on the site.
